üí° The project has a well documented README based on the provided template.

# üìÆ ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of our project

## üéØProject Goals
The overall objective is to provide a low-cost, fully accessible financial tracker and planner that helps users achieve their financial goals.

‚û°Ô∏è Problem Statement - As a user I want to be able to easily track my expenditure so that I can achieve my financial goals.

‚û°Ô∏è Objective(s) - The main objective is to provide a low-cost, responsive, fully-accessible financial tracker and planner.

‚û°Ô∏è Target Audience - The target audience are all users who want to track their progress toward their financial goals with smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

‚û°Ô∏è Benefits - Insights can be gained on spending habits and patterns. Monitoring progress toward reaching your financial goals is easy and accessible. 

While creating this project we were mindful to future-proof for scalibility.  Google sheets was initially used as a backend - this was chosen as it was felt that this app should really have a way of saving data so that a returning user can enter spending data, in particular, over a period of time.

One way (perhaps a final solution) would be to build this using Django frameworks which support full database and authentication functionality. To reduce deployment complexity, we opted for Google sheets. This has embarked us on a learning curve with Flask (used as the bridge between HTML and Python).

## Site Features
Site features(first draft):
F01 Site purpose is clearly identified and apparent a user who reaches the site
(Future. as in the very near future before we submit)
Information is organised logically, with goal-setting, spend tracking, budget monitoring and insight analysis.
There is an infomative 'About' page and an opportunity for the user to provide feedback, suggestions for future development, or issues withthe site.


This satisfies user required FTU01 - clear site purpose in order to decide to proceed.

** F02 Ease of navigation**
The overall site layout follows a show-hide system, so relevant sections of the site are visible to the user.
A navgation bar gives ease of movement between the various site functions.

At the bottom of each section there is a 'minimise' arrow to hide the relevant section and return to the navbar options.
This satisfies user requirements FTU02, FTU03, allowing the user, whether first-time or returning user to navigate smoothly within the site.

** F03 Responsivess **
The site was constructed on a mobile-first principle. Each section has been constructed to be responsive to the screen size of the device it is run on.
Responsive design principles such as using on-sceen buttons, pre-filled prompts and pop-ups rather than text-based entry, make the site good for small-screen usage.

This satisfies first-time user requirements FTU05

** F04 Accessibility and Performance **
The site performs well and satisfies accessibiliyt guidenlines (CHECK)
